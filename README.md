 CECS 450  Data Visualization Final Project - Spring 2024

This project is part of the CECS 450 course, where the objective is to create an interactive dashboard to explore and analyze customer data. The project focuses on customer churn analysis and various data visualizations using Tableau.

 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to prepare and analyze customer data to derive meaningful insights regarding customer churn, demographics, service usage, billing, and revenue analysis.

 Project Structure

 Part 1: Data Preparation
- Import the dataset into Tableau.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Handle missing values, data type conversions, and create calculated fields.

 Part 2: Initial Exploratory Analysis
- Basic visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts) for numeric variables.
- Distributions of categorical variables using bar charts.

 Part 3: Customer Churn Analysis
- Visualizations showing customer churn categories and reasons.
- Churn rate calculation and KPI display.

 Part 4: Geographic Analysis
- Maps to visualize customer distribution across cities and zip codes.

 Part 5: Customer Demographics
- Visualize demographics such as gender, marital status, age, and dependents.

 Part 6: Service Usage Analysis
- Visualizations for customer services like internet service, phone service, streaming, and additional services.

 Part 7: Customer Billing and Charges
- Visualizations for billing information including monthly charges and payment methods.

 Part 8: Revenue Analysis
- Time series charts showing total revenue over time.
- Visualizations for total charges, refunds, and other revenue-related fields.

 Part 9: Dashboard Creation
- Combine individual worksheets and visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard.
- Add interactive filters, parameters, and tooltips for user interaction.

 Part 10: Storytelling
- Create a guided story/narrative to explain key insights and trends.

 Part 11: Interactivity
- Ensure interactivity with filters, actions, and parameters.

 Part 12: Final Touches
- Format the dashboard for consistency and aesthetics.
- Test the dashboard and save as a Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx).

 Technologies Used
- Tableau for data visualization
- Customer Data (CSV file)

 Project Outcome
The project will showcase interactive dashboards with various insights into customer demographics, service usage, churn analysis, revenue, and billing. The interactive elements will allow users to explore the data from multiple perspectives and gain meaningful insights.
